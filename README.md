# COVID-19 Detection Model Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

Welcome to the COVID-19 Detection Model repository! This project aims to leverage the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to accurately classify chest X-ray images and identify COVID-19 cases. With the ongoing global pandemic, the need for rapid and reliable diagnostic tools has never been more critical. This model provides an AI-driven approach to assist healthcare professionals in the early detection of COVID-19, potentially aiding in faster diagnosis and treatment.

## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to develop a robust and accurate model that can differentiate between normal, pneumonia, and COVID-19 affected chest X-ray images. By utilizing CNNs, a type of deep learning algorithm particularly effective for image classification tasks, we have achieved high accuracy in identifying COVID-19 cases from X-ray images.

### Key Features

- **High Accuracy**: The model has been trained and tested on a diverse dataset, achieving impressive accuracy in classifying COVID-19 cases.
- **Data Augmentation**: To enhance the model's performance and generalization capability, various data augmentation techniques have been applied.
- **Transfer Learning**: Leveraging pre-trained models (such as ResNet, VGG, etc.) to improve the model's efficiency and accuracy.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A simple interface for healthcare professionals to upload X-ray images and get instant predictions.

## Dataset

The model has been trained on a comprehensive dataset comprising chest X-ray images from various sources. The dataset includes:
- **Normal**: Healthy chest X-ray images.
- **Pneumonia**: X-ray images of patients diagnosed with pneumonia.
- **COVID-19**: X-ray images of patients confirmed to have COVID-19.

Data preprocessing and augmentation techniques, such as rotation, zoom, and horizontal flipping, have been employed to ensure the model's robustness and ability to generalize well to new, unseen data.

## Model Architecture

The model utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, which is well-suited for image classification tasks. Key components of the architecture include:
- **Convolutional Layers**: To automatically learn and detect features from the input images.
- **Pooling Layers**: To reduce the spatial dimensions and computational complexity.
- **Fully Connected Layers**: To combine the features and make final predictions.

### Transfer Learning

To enhance the model's performance, transfer learning techniques have been used. Pre-trained models such as ResNet50, VGG16, and InceptionV3 have been fine-tuned on our dataset, leading to improved accuracy and faster convergence.

## Results

The model has demonstrated high accuracy and reliability in classifying chest X-ray images. Detailed performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, are provided in the [results section](#results) of this repository.
